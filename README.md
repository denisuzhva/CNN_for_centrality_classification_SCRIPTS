# Convolutional neural network for centrality analysis

NA61/SHINE experiment in CERN researches the strong fundamental interaction, specifically QGP to hadron matter phase transition. The research itself is possible if we can measure something, and here we measure fluctuations of the number of "spectators" (remaining parts of nuclei from the beam). This fluctuations affect energy of the spectators, which we can register with the Projectile Spectator Detector (PSD), and topology of tracks they leave inside it. In fact, the PSD is a cubic lattice construction that can be imagined as a 3D matrix with cubic pixels or, more precisely, voxels. In this way, it is interesting to apply a convolutional neural networks with 3D kernels to to the analysis of data from PSD and compare the results with classical methods, such as histogram analysis.
